# Pig-Dice-Game

A simple turn based dice games where two players compete to reach a target score in this case 50.
On each turn a player rolls a 6 sided die as many times as they like, adding the rolled number to their turn total. However if the player rolls a 1,
their turn ends and they score defaults to 0. Whoever score 50 points first wins!
